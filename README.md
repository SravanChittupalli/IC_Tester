# IC_Tester

    ICs are the main components of each and every electronic circuit and can be used for a wide variety of functions. 
But if the IC is faulty, it becomes a tedious work to debug the circuit and confirm where exactly the problem is. 
    
    We recently experienced this during our DCC practical. Even though 2 hours have been allotted for lab, at least an 
hour and half goes in debugging and checking the ICs, thereby leaving us with a very little time to actually implement 
the logic and build a circuit.
	  
    So, to come up with these sorts of problems, we intend to make a project which would confirm whether an 
IC is faulty or not and thus save a lot of time.

    Semiconductor test equipment (IC tester), or automated test equipment (ATE), is a system for giving electrical signals
to a semiconductor device to compare output signals against expected values for the purpose of testing if the device works 
as specified in its design specifications.

    To start with, we will be implementing an IC Tester to check whether the gate/IC is faulty or not only for basic TTL Logic gates.
